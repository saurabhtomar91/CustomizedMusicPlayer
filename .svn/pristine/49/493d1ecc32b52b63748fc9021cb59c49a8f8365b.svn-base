/**
 * Implement to handle an item being dropped.
 * An adapter handling the underlying data 
 * will most likely handle this interface.

	/**
	 * Called when an item is to be dropped.
   *
   * The <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> parameters can be thought of
   * as the order that items will be listed.
   *
   * So for example if you have four
   * records in your adapter and they have a field showing the order they
   * should be listed, the from and to tell you how to change the order of
   * records.
   *
   * If the drop command says to change 'from' 1, 'to' 3 then you would
   * arrange the data like so:
   *
   *     +------------+     +------------+
   *     | id | order |     | id | order |
   *     +----+-------+     +----+-------+
   *     |  0 |  0    |     |  0 |  0    |
   *     |  1 |  1    | ==> |  1 |  3    |
   *     |  2 |  2    |     |  2 |  1    |
   *     |  3 |  3    |     |  3 |  2    |
   *     +----+-------+     +----+-------+
   *
	 * @param from - index item started at in the original list.
	 * @param to - index the item should be at in the final list.
